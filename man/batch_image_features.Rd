\title{Detects image features for a list of images}
\usage{
batch_image_features(imgs, auth = FALSE, cloud = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{imgs}{image data}

\item{auth}{Username and password for HTTP Basic Auth}

\item{cloud}{subdomain for indico private cloud}
}
\value{
List of lists with image features
}
\description{
Given a list of input images, returns a list of 2048 dimensional sparse feature vectors explaining that image.
Useful as a form of feature engineering for image oriented tasks.
}
\details{
* Input can be either grayscale or rgb color and should either be a numpy array or nested list format.

* Input data should be either uint8 0-255 range values or floating point between 0 and 1.

* Large images (i.e. 1024x768+) are much bigger than needed, resizing will be done internally to 64x64 if needed.

* For ideal performance, images should be square aspect ratio but non-square aspect ratios are supported as well.
}
\examples{
imgs <- c(matrix(runif(64*64, 0, 1), nrow = 64))
features <- image_features(imgs)

length(features)
length(features[[1]])
min(unlist(features[[1]]))
max(unlist(features[[1]]))
sum(unlist(features[[1]]))
